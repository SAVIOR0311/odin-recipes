    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A hamburger, or simply a burger, is a dish consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or 
        bread roll.</p>
    <p>The patties are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, bacon, or chilis with condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise, 
        relish or a "special sauce", often a variation of Thousand Island dressing, and are frequently placed on sesame seed buns.</p>     
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>1 pound ground beef</li>
        <li>½ cup fine dry bread crumbs</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil grate.</li>
        <li>Whisk egg, salt, and pepper together in a medium bowl.</li>
        <li>Add ground beef and bread crumbs; mix with your hands or a fork until well blended.</li>
        <li>Form into four 3/4-inch-thick patties.</li>
        <li>Place patties on the preheated grill. Cover and cook 6 to 8 minutes per side, or to desired doneness. 
            An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 160 degrees F (70 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
